## Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>

The dataset used in this project, named 'AAPL_short_volume.csv', is extracted from OpenBB, a prominent open-source investment analysis company. The dataset consists of historical closing prices of AAPL stock, which will be used for training and evaluating our machine-learning models. The 'AAPL_short_volume.csv' file can be found in the "data" directory of this repository.

## Model Overview <a name="model-overview"></a>

Several machine learning models are implemented for stock price forecasting, including:

- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) model 
- Random Forest model 
- Gradient Boosting methods (XGBoost and LightGBM)

These models will be trained on the historical stock price data to predict future stock closing prices.

## Model Evaluation and Results <a name="model-evaluation-and-results"></a>

To evaluate the performance of each model, we use the **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** metric. The lower the RMSE value, the more accurate the model's predictions are. After evaluating all models, we found that the LSTM model demonstrates superior predictive performance, achieving the lowest RMSE compared to the other models. This highlights the strength and effectiveness of the LSTM model in accurately forecasting stock prices.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To run the code and reproduce the results:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended) along with the necessary libraries.
